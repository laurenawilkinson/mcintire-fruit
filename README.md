# McIntire Fruit

A site designed and developed for a fictional organic fruit-and-veg company, using Vue and Wordpress API. The company have both US and UK branches, selling regional and seasonal produce as well as hosting events and aiming to educate kids on the importance of healthy eating. They wanted to capture their local, family-friendly brand within the website to welcome new customers and increase the return visit rate on their site.

>Wordpress API is currently unhosted, so products will not be available at this time.
